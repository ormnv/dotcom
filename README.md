Purpose and Inspiration

The purpose of this project is to solidify my web development knowledge by creating a website from scratch from concept to development. I wanted a simple, utilitatian site that linked to my profiles on the web with the goal of the content BEING the design with subtle interactivity to keep it modern. I wanted to largely avoid modern design trends strictly associated with the present or very recent past such as paralax or skeuomorphism. I considered the simplicity of websites of academics and remembered my old geocities site. I gathered 90's inspiration from New York Public Theater posters, NASA flyers as well as dance music record art and athletic logos. Once I had the concept down, I passed my ideas to my good friend and graphic designer, Andrea. We were both really happy with the result so I began to build. 


Description

The project is a simple one page site that consists of links to other sites. The mobile version is a vertical layout, while other versions have a responsive, square layout. The project uses grunt.js, require.js, signals.js, jquery, sass, typekit and anchor cms for the blog. The custom theme for anchor cms is in the themes folder under dotcom. Anchor CMS was not used for the final site, but may be used in the future. Only the vertical wobble effect was used from hover.css. All fonts are Futura via typekit. The repo also includes a moodboard folder which contains inspiration for the design of the website.

Afterthoughts 

As the project was a great learning experience, I am confident now in doing solo development from scratch. After working in teams with other developers and other diciplines, there were aspects of development which I did not have to give much consideration. For example, figuring out typekit and subtle positioning of elements were usually the roles of the producer and designer respectively. Thinking about UX and breakpoints certainly took more time than I expected since I ran into situations where elements looked especially awkward. Although I had a design, executing in practice required many incremental design decisions. I quickly reached a point where the website was largely done, but getting the details right actually took some significant reorganization of the sass code. I am happy with the result and learned a lot in the process.
