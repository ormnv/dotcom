======

The project is a simple one page site that consists of links to other sites. The mobile version is a vertical layout, while other versions have a responsive, square layout. The project uses grunt.js, require.js, signals.js, jquery, sass and anchor cms for the blog. The custom theme for anchor cms is in the themes folder under dotcom. Anchor CMS was not used for the final site, but may be used in the future. Only the vertical wobble effect was used from hover.css. All fonts are Futura via typekit. The repo also includes a moodboard folder which contains inspiration for the design of the website.
